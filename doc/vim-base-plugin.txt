    Displays the current system time in the command line.

MAPPINGS                                        *vim-version-display-mappings*

<Leader>svv                                      *<Leader>svv*
    Quickly display the Vim version (in normal mode).

-----

Note: This plugin uses <Leader> in its mappings. By default, <Leader> is set to
backslash (\) in Vim. If you have customized your <Leader> key, the actual key
combination to trigger the mapping will be different. For example, if you have
set your <Leader> to space, you would press "Space+vv" instead of "\vv" to
display the Vim version.
